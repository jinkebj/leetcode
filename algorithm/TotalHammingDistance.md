# Total Hamming Distance

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Now your job is to find the total Hamming distance between all pairs of the given numbers.

Example:

    Input: 4, 14, 2

    Output: 6

Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010 (just
showing the four bits relevant in this case). So the answer will be:
HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Note:

    Elements of the given array are in the range of 0 to 10^9
    Length of the array will not exceed 10^4.

**Analysis:**

Assuming we have an array of five integers a, b, c, d, e as follow.
We examine the digits one by one from the last digit.
Count the number of integers whose last digit is 1, assign the value to ones

    a = 0 0 0 1 0
    b = 1 0 0 1 1
    c = 0 1 0 0 1
    d = 1 0 0 1 0
    e = 0 0 0 1 0
                â†‘
    ones: b, c
    zeros: a, d, e

    pairs that make distance are:
    b: a, d, e
    c: a, d, e

    So we have 2 ones and 5 - 2 = 3 zeros
    Total distance = 2 * 3
    then we move the pointer one position left, i.e. all the numbers right shift by 1 (num >>> 1)

**Java:**
```java
class Solution {
    public int totalHammingDistance(int[] nums) {
        int total = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        for (int j = 0; j < 32; j++) { // 32 digits in integers
            int bitCount = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                bitCount += (nums[i] >> j) & 1;
            total += bitCount * (n - bitCount);
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```
